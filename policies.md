COLLECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURE
In compliance with the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act and The Condominium
Declaration for The Wildflower Condominiums, the Board of Directors desires to adopt a uniform
and systematic procedure regarding collection of assessments and other charges.
The Association hereby adopts the following policy and procedures for collection of
assessments:
1. Due Dates, Late Charges, Interest, Suspension of Rights, and Acceleration of
Assessments.
A. Due Dates: Monthly installments of the annual assessment are due and payable
on the 1st day of each month. Payments shall be deemed received and shall be posted on the
date the payment is received in the Association's office or the Association's payment processor's
office. Any installment not paid in full when due shall be considered past due and delinquent.
B. Late Charge. A late charge in the amount of 20.00 shall be imposed without
further notice to the Owner on assessments, fines or other charges if not paid within 15 days of
due date. Such late charges are a personal obligation of the Owner and a lien on the Lot.
C. Interest. Interest at the rate of 21% per annum shall accrue on any delinquent
assessment, fine or other charge from the due date without further notice to the Owner. Interest
may be added to the Owner's account 15 days following the due date. Such Interest is a
personal obligation of the Owner and a lien on the Unit.
D. Suspension of Rights. An Owner's voting rights shall be automatically
suspended without notice if an assessment or other charge is not paid within 15 days of the due
date.
E. Acceleration. Upon 30 days written notice to the Owner, the Board may
accelerate and declare immediately due all of that Owner's unpaid installments of the annual
assessment. Upon acceleration, that Owner loses the privilege of paying any and all assessments
and charges in installments for the remainder of the fiscal year, unless such privilege is otherwise
reinstated in the Board's sole discretion.
2. Return Check Charges.
A. if any check or other instrument payable to or for the benefit of the Association is
not honored by the bank or is returned by the bank for any reason, including, but not limited to
insufficient funds, the Owner is liable to the Association for one of the following amounts, at the
option of the Association:
(I) An amount equal to the face amount of the check, draft, or money order
and a return check charge of $20.00 or an amount equal to the actual charges incurred by the
Association levied by the party returning the check, whichever is greater; or
(ii) If notice has been sent as provided in C.R.S. § 13-21-109 and the total
amount due as set forth in the notice is not paid within 15 days after such notice is given, the
person issuing the check, draft or money order shall be liable to the Association for collection for
three times the face amount of the check, but not less than $100.00.
B. Any returned check shall cause an account to be past due if full payment of the
monthly installment of the annual assessment or of any other charge is delinquent.
III
C. If two or more of an Owner's checks are returned unpaid by the bank within any
fiscal year, the Association may require that all of the Owner's future payments, for a period of
one year, be made by certified check or money order.
3. Attorney Fees. The Association shall be entitled to recover Its reasonable attorney fees
and collection costs incurred in the collection of assessments or other charges due the
Association from a delinquent Owner pursuant to the terms of the Declaration and Colorado law.
Attorney fees incurred by the Association shall be considered part of the assessments and shall
be due and payable immediately when incurred, upon demand.
4. Application of Payments. All payments received on account of any Owner or the Owner's
property, may be applied first to post-judgment attorney's fees, costs and expense; then to costs
and attorney's fees not reduced to a judgment; then to interest; then to late charges; then to
return check charges; then to fines and other amounts levied pursuant to the Declaration; then to
delinquent assessments; then to current assessments not reduced to judgment; and finally to
amounts reduced to judgment.
5. Delegation of Authority to Sign Notice of Lien. The Board of Directors delegates authority
to the Association's attorney to sign and acknowledge the Notice of Assessment Lien. This
delegation may be withdrawn at any time. In the event the delegation is withdrawn, the Board will
send written notice to the Association's attorney of the withdrawal.]
6. Time Frames. The following time frames shall be followed in the collection of monthly
installments of the annual assessment and for collection of other charges.
Due date
131 day of the month for

assessment or 15 days after

Notwithstanding the time frames set forth above, if a lien holder with priority over the
Association's lien (i.e., first mortgagee) takes title to a Unit through foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure, the Association may file a lien on the Unit for any delinquent payment.
Once accounts are turned over to the Association's attorney, Owners shall make payment to the
Association at the address of the Association's attorney. The Association's attorney shall consult
with the Association regarding collection procedures and payment arrangements.
6. Notices: Use of Certified Mail/Regular Mail. All notices other than monthly statements
and other routine notices shall be sent to the Owner by certified mail. For purposes of this policy,
the First Notice from the Association or manager shall be deemed to be a routine notice and may

2
be sent by regular first class mail, postage prepaid. All subsequent notices from the Association
or its manager and notices from the Association's legal counsel shall be sent by certified mail.
7. Referral of Delinquent Accounts to Attorneys. Upon referral of a delinquent account to
the Association's attorneys, the attorneys shall take appropriate action to collect the accounts
referred. After an account has been referred to the Association's attorney, the account shall
remain with the attorney until the account is settled, has a zero balance or is written off. The
Association's attorney Is authorized to take whatever action is necessary, in consultation with the
President of the Board of Directors or other person designated by the Board, believed to be in the
best interest of the Association, including, but not limited to:
A. Filing a lien against the delinquent Owner's property to provide record notice of
the Association's claim against the property, if not already filed;
B. Filing suit against the delinquent Owner for a money judgment. The purpose of
obtaining a personal judgment against the Owner is to allow the Association to pursue remedies
such as garnishment of the Owner's wages or bank account to collect judgment amounts;
C. Instituting a Judicial action of foreclosure on the Association's lien. The
Association may choose to foreclose on its lien in lieu of or in addition to suing an Owner for a
money judgment. The purpose of foreclosing is to obtain payment of all assessments owing in
situations where either a money judgment lawsuit has been or is likely to be unsuccessful or in
other circumstances that may favor such action;
D. Filing necessary claims, documents, and motions in Bankruptcy Court to protect
the Association's claim; and
E. Filing a court action seeking appointment of a receiver. A receiver is a
disinterested person, appointed by the court, who manages rental of the Owner's property, and
collects the rents according to the court's order. The purpose of a receivership for the
Association Is to obtain payment of current assessments, reduce past due assessments, and
prevent waste and deterioration of the property.
All payment plans involving accounts referred to an attorney for collection shall be set up and
monitored through the attorney.
Upon referral of any matter to the Association's attorney, the Association shall pay the
Association's attorneys their usual and customary charges as well as any costs incurred by the
attorney on the Association's behalf, promptly upon receipt of the monthly invoice from the
attorney.
8. Notification to and Communication with Owners. This Collection Policy shall be made
available to all Owners by the Association as required by Colorado law. After a delinquent
account has been referred to the Association's attorney, all communication with the delinquent
Owner shall be handled through the Association's attorney. Neither the manager, if any, nor any
member of the Board of Directors shall discuss the collection of the account directly with an
Owner after it has been turned over to the Association's attorney unless the attorney is present or
has consented to the contact. However, the Association has the option and right to continue to
evaluate each delinquency on a case by case basis.
9. Certificate of Status of Assessment/Estoppel Letter. The Association shall furnish to an
Owner or such Owner's designee upon written request, delivered personally or by certified mail,
first-class postage prepaid, return receipt, to the Association's registered agent, a written
statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments currently levied against the Owner's
Unit. The statement shall be delivered within 14 calendar days after receipt of the request
personally or by certified mail, first-class postage prepaid, return receipt requested for a fee
3
assessed in accordance with the management company's fee schedule for such statements,
which fee shall become an assessment. If the Owner's account has been turned over to the
Association's attorney, such statement shall be handled through the Association's attorney and
shall include any attorney fees incurred in providing the statement.
10. Bankruptcies and Public Trustee Foreclosures. Upon receipt of any notice of a
bankruptcy filing by an Owner, or upon receipt of a notice of a foreclosure by any holder of an
encumbrance against any Unit within the Association, the Association shall advise the
Association's attorney of the same and turn the account over to the Association's attorney.
11 . Waivers. The Association may alter the time for the filing of lawsuits and liens, or
otherwise modify the procedures contained herein, as the Association shall determine appropriate
under the particular circumstances. Any such accommodation shall be documented in the
Association's files with the conditions of relief. Failure of the Association to require strict
compliance with this Collection Policy shall not be deemed a waiver of the Association's right to
require strict compliance and shall not be deemed a defense to payment of assessment fees or
other charges, late charges, return check charges, attorney fees and/or costs as described and
Imposed by this Collection Policy.
12. Amendment. This Collection Policy may be amended from time to time by the Board of
Directors.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned certify that this Collection Policy and ri,./
Procedure was adopted by Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Association this  5  day
of  4-etLi  , 2006.

interest transaction are disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or the committee,

director or officer has knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such
reliance to be unwarranted. A director or officer shall not be liable to the Association or its
Members for any action the director or officer takes or omits to take as a director or officer if, in
connection with such action or omission, the director or officer performs his duties in compliance
with this policy. A director or officer, regardless of title, shall not be deemed to be a trustee with

authorized and empowered to purchase, invest in, acquire, sell or assign any and all types and
kinds of investments meeting the goals in paragraph 3; and to enter into agreements, contracts
and arrangements with respect to such security transactions and to execute, sign or endorse

DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
In compliance with the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act, the Board of Directors
desires to set forth policies and procedures regarding resolution of disputes.
1. Disputes between Association and Owners Regarding Collection and Covenant and Rule
Enforcement Matters. Disputes between the Association and Unit Owners regarding assessment
collection matters and covenant and rule enforcement matters are addressed in the Collection
Policy and the Covenant and Rule Enforcement Policy.
2. Disputes Between Residents. The Association encourages Owners or residents with
disputes among themselves to resolve such disputes without court proceedings. The Association
may take reasonable steps to facilitate negotiation or mediation between Owners and/or
residents, but will have no responsibility for any costs incurred by the parties to the dispute
resolution process. For any step in the dispute resolution process, the parties are not waiving
their right to employ legal counsel at their own expense to assist them.
3. Required Dispute Resolution Procedure
A. Prior to filing a lawsuit against the Association, the Board, or any officer, director,
or property manager of the Association, an Owner must request and attend a hearing with the
Board of Directors. Any such request shall be in writing and shall be personally delivered to any
member of the Board of Directors or the Association's property manager.
B. Upon receiving a request for a hearing, the Board shall give notice of the date, time
and place of the hearing to the person requesting the hearing. The Board shall schedule this
hearing for a date not less than 10 or more than 30 days from the date of receipt of the request.

the grievance to the Board and resolve the dispute in an amicable fashion, and shall give the Board
a reasonable opportunity to address the Owner's grievance.

mediation procedure set forth below, but shall not be required to do so.

in disputes between Owners and residents. At its discretion, the Board of Directors may utilize the
procedures set forth below to resolve disputes with Owners prior to filing litigation.
A. Negotiation. A request for dispute resolution by negotiation may be initiated by
an Owner or the Association. Any such request shall be in writing stating the nature and details
of the dispute and shall be personally delivered to the other party. So long as the other party

negotiate a resolution not less than 10 or more than 30 days of receipt of such request, unless
otherwise extended by written agreement. Through negotiation, the parties will communicate
directly with each other in an effort to reach an agreement that serves the interests of both

inspect the alleged defects or problems at a time convenient to everyone involved.

to decide how to resolve the dispute but will use recognized, accepted mediation techniques to
taggssist the parties in making that decision. The mediator shall be selected by a consensus of the
parties involved within 15 days of the receipt of the request. Any cost of mediation will be shared
