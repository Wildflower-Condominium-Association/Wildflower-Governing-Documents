The percentage interest in the Common Elements of each Unit has been determined by
the Declarant on the basis of the proportion which the approximate square footage fin-
ished area of each Apartment bears to the total approximate square footage finished
area of all of the Apartments In the Project (including Apartments created on the addi-
tional real property submitted to the Project). The square footage for each Apartment is
based upon dimensions which are approximate and the calculation of the Percentage
Interest has been rounded. The percentage interest in the Common Elements shown for
each Unit is subject to change in accordance with ARTICLE TWELVE of the Declaration.
In the event the Declarant exercises its right to enlarge this Project in Phases by
submitted to the Project additional real property In accordance with ARTICLE TWELVE
of the Declaration, each percentage interest in the Common Elements set forth above
will decrease. The Percentage Interest of each Unit will then be determined by the
Declarant on the basis of the proportion which the approximate square footage finished
area of each Apartment bears to the total approximate square footage finished area of
all completed Apartments within The Project (including Apartments created on the addi-
tipnal real property submitted to the Project).

NOTES ,
MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES:
This chart and the titles and headings used herein are not intended to describe or encompass all maintenance functions nor to delineate
all respective responsibilities between the Owners, severally, and the Association. The placement of responsibility under any specific
column does not always accurately reflect the precise character and nature of ownership. The appropriate sections of the Declaration
determine ownership. In many cases maintenance responsibility is allocated to the Association to ensure central maintenance responsi-
bility, uniformity and quality of repair, and to protect community health and safety. Where such maintenance is required due to the
negligent or wrongful act or omission of an Owner (or members of his household, tenants, employees, agents, visitors, guests or pets), the
Association will perform the necessary maintenance at the sole expense of the Owner.
COLUMN I: Items ' Items appearing in this column are illustrative and not exhaustive.
COLUMN II: Common Elements Under Association Responsibility • Responsibility for determining and providing for the maintenance,
repair and replacement requirements of the Common Elements and determining the costs thereof shall be primarily the responsibility of
the Board of Directors and such designees to which it may delegate certain such responsiblities.
COLUMN III: Limited Common Elements Under Association Responsibility ' Responsibility for determining the maintenance, repair and
replacement requirements of the Common Elements shall be shared responsibility between the Board of Directors and the Owner of a
Unit to which a specific Limited Common Element is exclusively appurtenant; provided, however, that the Board shall have the final
responsibility for determining the need for and accomplishing such maintenance, repair and replacement activities.
COLUMN IV: Unit Components Under Association Responsibility • The items in this column are legally and by definition a part of a Unit
but are attached or directly connected to or associated with the Common Elements and common expense items in such a way that a clear
distinction between Owner and Association responsibility cannot be made. Moreover, such items frequently involve matters of concern
relative to the general health, safety and welfare of all of the occupants of The Building. Thus, certain costs which appear to benefit a
single Owner but which affect other Owners are declared a common expense, especially when the correct functioning of an activity or
element is integral to or supportive of the legally defined Common Elements and common expenses.
COLUMN V: Certain Other Components Under Owner's Responsibility Without Respect to Ownership of the Component • The items in
this column are not intended to be exclusive and all-encompassing and do not affect responsibilities expressly provided for otherwise.
