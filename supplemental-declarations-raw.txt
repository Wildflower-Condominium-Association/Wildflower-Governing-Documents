Amendments thereto for the Wildflower Condominiums and the
Condominium Map and amendments thereto of the Wildflower
Condominium (herein referred to as the "Map"). Such
percentage interest in the Common Elements is determined by
the Declarant on the basis of the proportion which the
approximate square footage finished area of each Unit bears to
the total approximate square footage finished area of all
Units in the Project (including Units created on the
additional real property submitted to the Project). The
square footage for each Unit is based upon dimensions which
are approximate and the calculation of the individual
interests have been rounded. Such revised percentage
interests in the Common Elements are more specifically set
forth on Exhibit B attached hereto. The percentage interest
shown for each Unit is subject to change in accordance with
Article Twelve of the Declaration.
3. The definitions used in the Declaration shall be
expanded automatically to encompass and refer to—the
Project as expanded. All conveyances of Condominium
Units shall be effective to transfer rights in the
Project as expanded by use of the form of description set
forth in Paragraph 2.3 of the Declaration and the Map as
supplemented. The recordation in the records of Boulder
County, Colorado of the Supplemental Maps incident to the
expansion operates automatically to grant, transfer, and
convey to the Owners of the Condominium Units as they
existed before this expansion respectively an undivided
percentage interest as set forth on Exhibit "B" attached
hereto in the new Common Elements being added to the
Project as the result of such expansion. Such
recordation also operates to vest in any Mortgagee (as
defined in the Declaration) of any Condominium Unit in
the Project as it existed before this expansion a
security interest in the new undivided Common Elements
interest so acquired by an Owner of a Condominium Unit
which were added to the Project as the result of
expansion.
4. The new Condominium Units are subject to all of the
terms and conditions of the Declaration as supplemented
and such Condominium Units are subject to the condominium
regime with all the incidents pertaining thereto as
specified therein and herein upon placing the
2
Supplemental maps and the Supplemental Declarations of
public record in the real estate records of Boulder
County, Colorado.
5. Each Owner and Condominium Unit shall be liable for
its respective proportionate share of the Annual
Assessment for Common Expenses and Special Assessments in
accordance with Article Five of the Declaration.
6. The Owners of each Condominium Unit now or hereafter
included in the Condominium Project shall have a
perpetual easement and right-of-way for access to and
from such Condominium Unit over, upon and across the
Common Elements to and from the public streets within and
adjacent to the Project.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Declarant has executed this Eighth
Supplemental Declaration for the Wildflower tondominiums the year
and day first above written.
