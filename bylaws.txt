THE BYLAWS OF THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION

ARTICLE ONE: OBJECT

1.1 Association.
THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION is a non-profit corporation, organized under the Colorado Nonprofit Corporation Act, with its principal office at 4730 Table Mesa Drive, Boulder, Colorado 80303.

1.2 Purpose.
The purpose for which the Association is formed is to govern the residential community situated in the City of Louisville, State of Colorado, which is known as THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUMS, which is subject to the provisions of the Colorado Condominium Ownership Act and to THE CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION FOR THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUMS as amended from time to time recorded in the office of the County Clerk and Recorder, Boulder, Colorado, and further to advance, represent and serve the fiscal and economic best interests of all of the Members of the Association in all matters relating to their general welfare and their best interests in the administration, management and operation of the Association.

1.3 Definitions.
Terms used herein shall have the meanings specified for such terms in the Declaration.

1.4 Applicability.
All present or future owners, members, tenants, future tenants, or any other person that might use in any manner the facilities of The Project are subject to the Declaration and the mere act of occupancy of the said Condominium Apartments within The Project will signify that the Declaration and these Bylaws are accepted, ratified, and will be complied with.

ARTICLE TWO: MEMBERSHIP AND VOTING RIGHTS

2.1 Membership.
Each Owner of a Condominium Unit in THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUMS, including Declarant so long as it shall be an Owner, shall automatically become a member of the Association. Said membership is appurtenant to the Unit of said Owner and title to the ownership of the membership for that Unit shall automatically pass with fee simple title to the Unit. Each Owner of a Unit shall automatically be entitled to the benefits and subject to the burdens relating to the membership for his Unit. If the fee simple title to a Unit is held by more than one person, all such persons shall be members.

2.2 Voting Rifts.
The Association shall have two classes of voting memberships:
Class A. Class A Members shall be all Owners with the exception of the Declarant and shall be entitled to one vote for each Unit owned; provided, however, the Declarant shall be a Class A Member after the conversion of the Class B Membership to Class A Membership in accordance with this Paragraph and shall thereafter be entitled to one vote for each Unit owned.
The vote for such Unit, the ownership of which is held by more than one Owner, may be exercised by any one of them, unless an objection or protest by any other holder of an interest of the Unit is made prior to the completion of the vote, in which case the vote for such Unit shall be exercised, as the persons holding such interest shall determine between themselves. Should the joint owners of a Unit be unable, within a reasonable time, to agree upon how they will vote any issue, they shall be passed over and their right to vote on such issue shall be lost. In no event shall more than one vote be cast with respect to any such Unit.

Class B. The Class B Member shall be the Declarant. The Class B Member shall be entitled to three votes for each Unit owned. Class B Membership may be converted to Class A Membership at the option of the Declarant, by its written notice to the Secretary of the Association, but in any event shall be converted to Class A Membership without further act or deed not later than:
(a) four months from the date seventy-five percent of the Units in The Project have been conveyed to Unit Purchasers, other than the Declarant; or
(b) five years from the date of the recording of the Declaration in the Boulder County, Colorado records whichever shall first occur.
