# Wildflower Governing Documents

A conversion to accessible formats of the governing documents for the Wildflower Condominium Association.

The originals are seemingly lost to time. The official copies we currently have are  typewritten documents that were subsequently photographed, then scanned at a low resolution, often with poor contrast. The resulting files are difficult to read in general, useless for low-vision persons, impossible to mechanically translate, and a poor basis for making needed changes.

This repository contains the current official copies as PDFs, with (in-progress) transcriptions to Markdown format, which is easily readable as plain text. The result will become a reasonable basis for evolving the association's governing documents.
