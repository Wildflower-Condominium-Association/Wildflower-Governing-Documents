ARTICLE TWO: NATURE AND INCIDENTS OF CONDOMINIUM OWNERSHIP

2.1 Division into Units, Estates of an Owner.  
Subject to the provisions of ARTICLE TWELVE hereof, the Project is hereby divided into eighteen Units, each consisting of a separate fee simple estate in a particular Condominium Apartment, and an appurtenant undivided fee simple interest in the Common Elements. The undivided interest in the Common Elements appurtenant to a particular Condominium Apartment has been determined by the Declarant on the basis of the proportion which the approximate square footage finished area of each Apartment bears to the total approximate square footage finished area of all Apartments in The Project and is as set forth in Exhibit "B" attached hereto and incorporated herein.

2.2 Title.  
A Unit may be held and owned by more than one person as joint tenants or as tenants in common, or in any real property tenancy relationship recognized under the laws of the State of Colorado.

2.3 Description of a Condominium Unit.  
Every contract for the sale of a Unit written prior to the filing for record of The Map and this Declaration may legally describe a Unit by its identifying Unit number designation followed by the words "THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUMS" with further reference to The Map thereof to be filed for record and the Declaration to be recorded. Upon recordation of The Map and the Declaration in the records of the Clerk and Recorder of Boulder County, Colorado, such description shall be conclusively presumed to relate to the therein described Units.

Every deed, lease, mortgage, trust deed, will or other instrument may legally describe a Unit by its identifying number followed by the words THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUMS:
> A sufficient description of a Condominium Unit shall be as follows:  
> Condominium Unit No., THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUMS according to the CONDOMINIUM MAP FOR THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUMS recorded on Film [as Reception No.] and as defined by THE CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION FOR THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUMS recorded on Film [as Reception No.], in the Office of the County Clerk and Recorder, Boulder, Colorado.

Every description shall be good and sufficient for all purposes to sell, convey, transfer, encumber or otherwise affect not only the Condominium Apartment, but also the Common Elements and the right to use of the Limited Common elements appurtenant thereto. Each such description shall be construed to include: a nonexclusive easement for appropriate ingress and egress throughout The Project and for the use of the Common Elements which are not Limited Common Elements; the right to the appropriate exclusive use of the Limited Common Elements; and all other easements, obligations, limitations, rights, encumbrances, covenants, conditions and restrictions created in this Declaration.

The reference to The Map and Declaration in any instrument shall be deemed to include any supplements or amendments to The Map or Declaration, without specific reference(s) thereto.

2.4 Apartment Boundaries.  
The interior unfinished surfaces of the perimeter walls, lowermost floors and uppermost ceilings shall mark the perimeter boundaries of a Condominium Apartment and all lath, furring, wallboard, plasterboard, plaster, paneling, tiles, wallpaper, paint, finished flooring and any other materials constituting any part of the finished surfaces thereof are a part of the Condominium Apartments, and all other portions of the walls, floors, or ceilings are a part of the Common Elements.

If any chute, flue, duct, wire, conduit, bearing wall, bearing column, or any other fixtures lies partially within and partially outside the designated boundaries of a Condominium Apartment, any portion thereof serving only that Apartment is a Limited Common Element allocated solely to that Apartment, and any portion thereof serving more than one Apartment or any portion of the Common Elements is a part of the Common Elements.

Any shutters, awnings, window boxes, doorsteps, stoops, porches, balconies, patios, and all exterior doors and windows or other fixtures designed to serve a single Condominium Apartment, but located outside the Apartment's boundaries, are Limited Common Elements allocated exclusively to the Apartment.

Subject to the above, all spaces, interior partitions, and other fixtures and improvements located within the boundaries of a Condominium Apartment are a part of the Apartment.

2.5 Right to Combine Units.  
Declarant hereby reserves the right to physically combine the area or space of one Unit with the area or space of one or more adjoining Units; provided, however, that Declarant shall not exercise said right without the written consent of any Mortgagee having an interest in said Units. In the event of any such physical combining of Units to create a combined Unit, such combined Unit shall also include the combining of the fixtures and improvements and of the undivided interests in Common Elements appurtenant to the Units so combined. Declarant reserves the right to designate and convey to any purchaser of any such combined Units, as additional Limited Common Elements appurtenant thereto, any walls, floors or other structural separations between the Units so combined, or any space which would be occupied by such structural separations but for the combination of such Units; provided, however, that such walls, floors or other structural separations for such space shall automatically become Common Elements if the combined Units become subject to separate ownership in the future. This reserved right in Declarant shall terminate upon the conversion of the Class B Membership to Class A Membership in accordance with Paragraph 4.5 hereof.

2.6 Physical Boundaries.  
In interpreting deeds, mortgages, deeds of trust and other instruments for any purpose whatsoever, or in connection with any matter, the existing physical boundaries of any Condominium Apartment or Common Elements shall be conclusively presumed to be the boundaries regardless of settling, rising or lateral movements of The Building, and regardless of variance between boundaries as shown on The Map and the actual boundaries of The Building.

2.7 Inseparability of a Unit.  
An Owner's undivided interest in the Common Elements shall not be separated from the Condominium Apartment to which it is appurtenant and shall be deemed to be conveyed or encumbered with the Condominium Apartment even though the interest is not expressly mentioned or described in a deed or other instrument.

2.8 No Partition.  
The Common Elements shall remain undivided, and no owner or any other person shall bring any action for partition or division of the Common Elements. Similarly, no action shall be brought for the physical partition or subdivision of a Condominium Apartment or a Unit between or among the Owners thereof, provided, however, an action of partition of a Unit shall be permitted by sale and the division of the sale proceeds.

2.9 Separate Taxation.  
Each Unit shall be deemed to be a parcel and shall be subject to separate assessment and taxation by each assessing unit and special district for all types of taxes authorized by law, including ad valorem levies and special assessments. Neither The Building, The Property nor any of the Common Elements shall be deemed to be a parcel. The lien for taxes assessed to any Unit shall be confined to that Unit. No forfeiture or sale of any Unit for delinquent taxes, assessments or other governmental charges shall divest or in any way affect the title to any other Unit.

2.10 Limited Common Elements.  
Subject to the definition thereof, the Limited Common Elements shall be identified on The Map. Any deck, balcony, door, window, entry way, patio, garage space, basement space, garage aprons and the space within the fire box located within a fireplace or stove which are accessible from, associated with and which adjoins a Condominium Apartment identified as Limited Common Elements on The Map shall without further reference thereto, be used in connection with such Condominium Apartment to the exclusion of the use thereof by the other Owners, except by invitation.

2.11 Compliance with Provisions of Declaration, Articles and Bylaws of the Association.  
Each Owner shall comply strictly with, and shall cause each of his Guests to comply strictly with, all of the provisions of this Declaration and the Articles and Bylaws of the Association, and the decisions, rules, regulations and resolutions of the Association adopted pursuant thereto, as the same may be lawfully amended from time to time. Failure to comply with any of the same shall be grounds for an action to recover sums due and for damages or injunctive relief or both, along with costs of suit and reasonable attorneys' fees, maintainable by the Board of Directors in the name of the Association on behalf of the Owners, or, in a proper case, by an aggrieved Owner.

2.12 Liens Against Condominium Apartments - Removal From Lien - Effect of Part Payment.  
Upon the completion of The Project by the Declarant and payment of all of the costs thereof, no lien shall arise or be effective, against The Project. Liens or encumbrances shall only arise or be created against each Condominium Apartment and the percentage of undivided interest in the Common Elements appurtenant to the Condominium Apartment, in the same manner and under the same conditions as liens and encumbrances may arise or be created upon any other parcel of real property subject to individual ownership; provided, however, that no labor performed or materials furnished, with the consent or at the request of an Owner or his agent shall be the basis for the filing of a lien pursuant to law against the Unit or other property of another Owner not expressly consenting to or requesting the same, except that express consent shall be deemed to be given by the Owner of any Unit to the Board in the case of emergency repairs. Labor performed or materials furnished for the Common Elements, if duly authorized by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Declaration or Bylaws, shall be deemed to be performed or furnished with the express consent of each Owner, and shall be the basis for the filing of a lien pursuant to law against each of the Units within The Project.

In the event a lien is effected against two or more Units, the Owners of each of the separate Units may remove their Condominium Apartment and the percentage of undivided interests in the Common Elements appurtenant to said Condominium Apartment from the lien by payment of the fractional or proportional amount attributable to each of the Units affected. Individual payment shall be computed by reference to the percentages appearing in this Declaration. Subsequent to payment, discharge or other satisfaction, the Unit shall be released from the lien paid, satisfied or discharged. Partial payment, satisfaction or discharge shall not prevent the lienor from proceeding to enforce his rights against any Unit not so released or discharged.

Each Owner shall indemnify and hold each of the other Owners harmless from and against liability or loss arising from the claim of any lien against the Unit of the Owner, or any part thereof, for labor performed or for materials furnished in the course of work performed on such Owner's Unit. At the written request of any Owner, the Board shall enforce such indemnity by collecting from the Owner of the Unit on which the labor was performed and materials furnished the amount necessary to discharge any such lien and all costs incidental thereto, including reasonable attorneys' fees by an Individual Assessment against such Owner in accordance with Paragraph 5.3(b) hereof.

2.13 Sale of a Condominium Unit.  
The right of an Owner to sell, transfer or otherwise convey his Unit shall not be subject to any right of first refusal or similar restriction and such Unit shall be sold free of any such restrictions.

2.14 Restrictions on Mortgaging Units.  
There are no restrictions on the right of an Owner to mortgage or otherwise encumber his Unit. There is no requirement for the use of a specific lending institution or particular type lender.

2.15 Parking Spaces.  
Certain Parking Spaces contained within The Project shall be a part of the Limited Common Elements and shall be limited to and reserved for the exclusive use of the Owners of a particular Condominium Unit as designated by the Board of Directors; provided however, the Board of Directors shall maintain control thereof and shall have the continuing right to assign and reassign Parking Spaces to Owners within The Project. A Parking Space is not appurtenant to a Unit purchased.

Certain Parking Spaces contained within The Project shall be a part of the Common Elements and shall be designated as Guest Parking Spaces. All Parking Spaces and their appropriate designations shall be depicted on The Map.

2.16 Garage Spaces.  
All Garage Spaces contained within The Project shall be a part of the Limited Common Elements. Each Garage Space shall be limited to and reserved for the exclusive use of the owners of a particular Condominium Unit as initially designated by the Declarant and upon such designation the said Garage Space will be appurtenant to that Unit.

2.17 Storage Spaces.  
All Storage Spaces contained within The Project shall be a part of the Limited Common Elements. Each storage space shall be limited to and reserved for the exclusive use of the owners of a particular Condominium Unit as designated by the Board of Directors; provided however, that the Board of Directors shall maintain control thereof and shall have the continuing right to assign and reassign storage spaces to owners within The Project. A storage space is not appurtenant to a Unit purchased.

2.18 Basement Spaces.  
All Basement Spaces contained within The Project shall be a part of the Limited Common Elements. Each Basement Space shall be limited to and reserved for the exclusive use of the owners of a particular Condominium Unit as initially designated by the Declarant and upon such designation the said Basement Space will be appurtenant to that Unit.


ARTICLE THREE: VARIOUS RIGHTS AND EASEMENTS

3.1 Owner's Rights in Limited Common Elements.  
Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 2.15 & 2.17, each Owner and his Guests shall have an exclusive right to use and enjoy the Limited Common Elements designated herein or on The Map as appurtenant to the Unit owned by such Owner.

3.2 Owner's Easement for Access, Support and Utilities.  
Each Owner shall have a non-exclusive easement for access between his Condominium Apartment and the roads and streets within and adjacent to The Project. There shall be no restrictions upon any Owner's right of ingress and egress to or from such Owner's Apartment. Each Owner shall have a non-exclusive easement in and over the Common Elements within the Condominium Project including the Common Elements within the Condominium Apartment of another Owner, for horizontal and lateral support of the Condominium Apartment which is part of his Unit, and for utility service to the Condominium Apartment, including water, sewer, gas, electricity, telephone and television service.

3.3 Easements for Encroachments.  
If any part of the Common Elements encroaches or shall hereafter encroach upon a Condominium Apartment, an easement for such encroachment and for the maintenance of the same shall and does exist. If any part of a Condominium Apartment encroaches or shall hereafter encroach upon the Common Elements, or upon another Condominium Apartment, the Owner of that Condominium Apartment shall and does have an easement for such encroachment and for the maintenance of same. Such easements for encroachments shall extend for whatever period of time the encroachment shall exist. Such encroachments shall not be considered to be encumbrances either on the Common Elements or on a Condominium Apartment. Encroachments referred to herein include, but are not limited to, encroachments caused by error in the original construction of The Building, by error in The Map, by settling, rising or shifting of the earth, or by changes in position caused by repair or reconstruction of The Project or any part thereof or by any other movement of any portion of the improvements located upon The Project.

3.4 Easement in Condominium Apartments for Repair, Maintenance and Emergencies.  
Some of the Common Elements are or may be located within a Condominium Apartment or may be conveniently accessible only through a particular Condominium Apartment. All Owners shall permit a right of entry to the Board of Directors, or any other person authorized by the Board of Directors, whether the Owner is present or not, for access through each Condominium Apartment to all Common Elements, from time to time, as may be necessary for the routine maintenance, repair, or replacement of any of the Common Elements located thereon or accessible therefrom or for making emergency repairs necessary to prevent damage to the Common Elements or to another Condominium Apartment. For routine maintenance and non-emergency repairs, entry shall be made only on a regular business day during regular business hours, after service of at least one day's notice in writing to the Owner. In case of emergency, entry shall be made at any time provided that a reasonable effort according to the circumstances is made to give notice to entry. In the event of such emergency, entry shall be made by the use of a "Master Key" which shall be owned and held by the Board of Directors, which key shall grant access to all of the Apartments within The Project. Each Owner shall allow the Board of Directors entry in the case of emergency to his Apartment by use of this "Master Key".

In the event that an Owner changes his entry lock so that the "Master Key" does not grant entry, he shall so notify the Secretary of the Association and place his key on file with the Board of Directors. In the event of such a change in lock and the failure to provide an entrance key to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors or its agents is granted the authority to use such reasonable force as is necessary to gain entry into the Apartment in the event of an emergency, if no other means of entry are available in view of the circumstances. The Owner of such Apartment shall bear the full responsibility and expense of all damages incurred to the Apartment and/or Common Elements because of such forcible entry.

Except for damages incurred in the case of entry to handle an emergency as provided for above, all damage to the interior or any part of a Condominium Apartment resulting from the maintenance, repair, emergency repair or replacement of any of the Common Elements, at the instance of the Association, shall be paid for as part of the Annual Assessments for Common Expenses by all of the Owners. No diminution or abatement of Annual Assessments for Common Expenses shall be claimed or allowed for inconveniences or discomfort arising from the making of repairs or improvements or from action taken to comply with any law, ordinance or order of any governmental authority. Restoration of the damaged improvements shall be substantially the same as the condition in which they existed prior to damage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such damage is the result of the carelessness or negligence of any Owner, then such Owner shall be solely responsible for the costs of repairing such damage. In the event the Owner fails within a reasonable time upon proper notice to pay the cost of the damages incurred, the Board of Directors may pay for said damages and charge the Owner responsible as an Individual Assessment in accordance with Paragraph 5.3(b) hereof.

Such easements and rights-of-way however shall not inhibit the use of the Common Elements by the Owners and their Guests. The Declarant shall be fully responsible for any damage to the Common Elements caused by its use of such easements and rights of way.

These reservations shall terminate at the option of the Declarant by its written notice to the Secretary of the Association, but in any event such reservations shall terminate without further act or deed not later than:

The Board of Directors shall be granted all of the powers necessary to grant such easements.

In the event the Association or an Owner wishes to utilize solar energy, the Association shall call a Special Meeting of the Owners and shall submit the plans and specifications at that Special Meeting describing the new construction and the easements needed.

    In the event it shall become necessary for the Board to collect any delinquent assessments, whether by foreclosure of a lien herein created or otherwise, the delinquent Owner shall pay, in addition to the assessment, and late fees as herein provided, all costs of collection including a reasonable attorney's fee and costs incurred by the Association in enforcing payment. In the event a "Notice of Lien" is required to be filed to enforce collection, the cost of preparation, filing and release shall be considered a cost of collection.

The rights of the Association shall be expressly subordinate to the rights of any First Mortgagee as set forth in his deed of trust or mortgage (including any assignment of rents) which creates that First Mortgagee's interest in the Unit.
    
    In addition to the lien herein granted, the Board shall have the right to bring an action at law against any Owner who fails to pay any amounts assessed against his Unit and obtain judgment for the amount of the assessments due, together with late fees accrued plus attorneys' fees and costs as herein provided and all costs incurred, including reasonable attorneys' fees in collecting the judgement.

- (h) The lien of all assessments created and defined by this Declaration shall be superior to any homestead exemption as is now or may hereafter be provided by Colorado or Federal law. The acceptance of a deed to a Unit subject to this Declaration shall constitute a waiver of the homestead exemption as against said assessment lien.

Provided however, the Association shall still have the right to recover such amount from the delinquent Owner. No transfer of title, or cancellation or forfeiture of executory land sales contract shall relieve such Unit from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof.

    Any such delinquent assessments which were extinguished pursuant to the foregoing provisions may be reallocated and assessed to all Owners as part of the Annual Assessment for Common Expenses.

- (j) The Association shall upon demand, and for a reasonable charge, furnish to an Owner, or his First Mortgagee, a certificate signed by an officer of the Association setting forth whether the assessments on a specified Unit have been paid. A properly executed certificate of the Association as to the status of assessments on a Unit is binding upon the Association as of the date of its issuance.

5.9 Declarant's Obligations.  
The Declarant for each Unit owned within each Phase of The Project, shall pay to the Association, twenty-five percent of the Annual Assessment for Common Expenses until such time as the Unit is sold, leased or occupied as a residence. Upon the happening of any of the above, such Unit shall be liable for the payment of the full Annual Assessment for Common Expenses.

The Declarant agrees that it has a binding obligation and a duty to pay any deficit or shortage that may arise in connection with the estimated budget prepared for the initial period of the operation of the Association.

The Association shall establish a Working Capital Fund to cover the costs of the initial period of The Project's operation. Each Unit's contribution to the Fund shall be equal to at least a two month's installment of the Annual Assessment for Common Expenses for such Unit. Each Unit's non-refundable contribution shall be collected and transferred to the Association at the time of the closing of the initial sale of such Unit and be maintained in a segregated account for the use and benefit of the Association. The purpose of the Fund is to insure that the Association will have cash available to meet foreseen expenditures or to acquire additional equipment or services deemed necessary or desirable by the Board. Contributions paid into the Fund are not considered as advance payments of the Annual Assessment for Common Expenses and each Owner must pay the Annual Assessment for Common Expenses as the same becomes due.

7.1 Authority to Purchase/General Requirements.  
Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 7.7 hereof, all insurance policies relating to The Project shall be purchased by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, the Managing Agent and the Declarant shall not be liable for failure to obtain any coverages required by this Article or for any loss or damage resulting from such failure if such failure is due to the unavailability of such coverages from reputable insurance companies, or if such coverages are so available only at demonstrably unreasonable cost. The Board of Directors shall promptly furnish to each Owner and/or such Owner's First Mortgagee requesting same, written notice of the procurement of, subsequent changes in, or termination of, insurance coverages obtained on behalf of the Association.

The Board of Directors shall not obtain any policy where (a) under the terms of the insurance company's charter, bylaws or policy, contributions or assessments may be made against the Association, Owner, First Mortgagee or such First Mortgagee's successor and assigns, or (b) by the terms of carrier's charter, bylaws or policy, loss payments are contingent upon action by the carrier's Board of Directors, policyholders or members; or (c) the policy includes any limited clauses (other than insurance conditions) which could prevent Owners or First Mortgagees, their successors and assigns from collecting insurance proceeds.

Each such policy shall provide that:
- (a) The insurer to the extent possible waives any right to claim by way of subrogation against the Declarant, the Association, the Board of Directors, the Managing Agent or the Owners, and their respective agents, employees, Guests and, in the case of the Owners, the members of their households.
- (b) Such policy shall not be cancelled, invalidated or suspended due to the conduct of any Owner or his or her Guests or of any Member, officer or employee of the Board of Directors or the Managing Agent without a prior demand in writing that the Board or the Managing Agent cure the defect and neither shall have so cured such defect within thirty days after such demand.
- (c) Such policy, including any fidelity insurance of the Association referred to in Paragraph 7.4 hereof may not be cancelled, reduced in coverage, or substantially modified by any party (including cancellation for non-payment of premium) without at least thirty days prior written notice to the Board of Directors, the Managing Agent and to each First Mortgagee listed as a scheduled holder of a first mortgage in the policy.
- (d) Such policy must provide that no assessment may be made against a First Mortgagee, its successors or assigns and that any assessment made against others shall not become a lien upon a Unit superior to the lien of a First Mortgagee's.
- (e) The Declarant, so long as Declarant shall own any Unit, shall be protected by all such policies as an Owner.

All policies of insurance shall be written by reputable companies duly authorized and licensed to do business in the State of Colorado and be in a financial category as designated in BEST'S INSURANCE REPORTS of Class X-B or better.

The name of the insured under the policies shall be the Association for the use and benefit of the individual Owners. Any loss covered by the policies carried under this Article shall be adjusted exclusively by the Association, and the insurance proceeds for that loss shall be payable to the Association as trustee for each Owner and such Owner's First Mortgagee. Each Owner and such Owner's First Mortgagee, if any, shall be beneficiaries of the insurance policy or policies according to each Owner's interest as such interests appear in the policy or policies, or in the event separate interests are not designated in the policy, then pro rata according to each Owner's percentage interest in the Common Elements.

All insurance policies shall contain the standard mortgagee clause or equivalent endorsement (without contribution) in which it appropriately names the First Mortgagee in the policy, its successors and assigns, beneficiary.

7.2 <a id="7.2"></a>Hazard Insurance.  
The Board of Directors shall obtain and maintain a blanket, "all-risk" form policy of hazard insurance with extended coverage, vandalism, malicious mischief, windstorm, sprinkler leakage (if applicable), debris removal, cost of demolition and water damage endorsements, insuring all the Common Elements and Limited Common Elements within The Project including fixtures, machinery, equipment and supplies maintained for the service of The Project, as well as common personal property belonging to the Association. Such insurance shall be in the amount of the full current replacement cost, as defined below, to include, among other things, all fixtures, improvements, alterations and equipment, comprising a part of the individual Apartment within the unfinished interior surfaces of the perimeter walls, floors and ceilings of the Apartment initially installed or replacements thereof, in accordance with the original Plans and specifications, or installed by or at the expense of the Owner and provide that all claims are to be settled on a replacement cost basis. All references herein to a "blanket" type policy of property insurance, are intended to denote "Single Entity" condominium insurance coverage.

In addition, any fixtures, equipment or other property within the Apartments which are to be financed by a First Mortgagee (regardless of whether or not such property is a part of the Common Elements) must be covered in such "blanket" policy.

Such insurance shall at all times represent one hundred percent of the current replacement cost of The Project based on the most recent appraisal of the entire Project. The replacement cost shall not include values for land, foundation, excavation and other items normally excluded therefrom and shall be without deduction for depreciation and with no provision for co-insurance. The Board of Directors shall review at least annually all of its insurance policies in order to insure that the coverages contained in the policies are sufficient. The Board of Directors shall be consistent with good business practices, and at reasonable intervals obtain a written appraisal for insurance purposes, which shall be maintained as a permanent record, showing that the insurance represents one hundred percent of the current replacement cost of The Project as defined above.

Such policies shall also provide:
- (a) The following endorsements or their equivalent: No Control Endorsement, Contingent Liability from Operation of Building Laws or Codes Endorsement, (Loss of value for an undamaged portion, Cost of Demolition and Increased Cost of Construction), Agreed Amount Endorsement, and Inflation Guard Endorsement, if available.
- (b) That any "no other insurance" clause expressly exclude individual Owners policies from its operation so that the hazards insurance policy purchased by the Board of Directors shall be deemed primary coverage and any individual Owner's policies shall be deemed excess coverage, and in no event shall the insurance coverage obtained and maintained by the Board of Directors hereunder provide for or be brought into contribution with insurance purchased by individual Owners or their First Mortgagees, unless otherwise required by law. 

The deductible, if any, on such insurance policy shall be as the Directors determine to be consistent with good business practice and which shall be consistent with the requirements of the First Mortgagees, not to exceed, however, Ten Thousand Dollars or one percent of the face amount of the policy whichever is less. Any loss falling within the deductible portion of a policy shall be paid by the person or entity who is responsible for the repair and maintenance of the property which was damaged or destroyed. In the event of a joint duty of repair and maintenance of the property damaged or destroyed then the deductible shall be paid by the Association. Funds to cover the deductible amounts should be included in the Association's Reserve Funds and be so designated.

A duplicate original of the policy of hazard insurance, all renewals thereof, and any subpolicies or certificates and endorsements issued thereunder, together with proof of payment of premiums, shall be delivered by the insurer to any Owner and First Mortgagee requesting the same, at least thirty days prior to expiration of the current policy.

The Association shall hold any insurance proceeds received in trust for the Owners and First Mortgagees as their interests may appear. The proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged Common Elements and Apartments. Owners and First Mortgagees are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the Common Elements and Apartments have been repaired or restored or The Project is terminated.

7.3 Liability Insurance.  
The Board of Directors shall obtain and maintain comprehensive general liability insurance (including libel, slander, false arrest, and invasion of privacy) and property damage insurance covering all of the Common Elements, public ways of The Project and any other areas that are under the Association's responsibility and commercial spaces owned by the Association whether or not they are leased to some third party insuring each Officer, Director, the Managing Agent and each Owner, to include the Declarant in its capacity as an Owner. Such coverage under this policy shall include, without limitation, the legal liability of the insureds for property damage, bodily injuries and deaths of persons that result from the operation, maintenance or use of the Common Elements and the legal liability arising out of lawsuits relating to employment contracts in which the Association is a party.

Such insurance shall be issued on a comprehensive liability basis. Additional coverages may be required to include protection against such other risks as are customarily covered with respect to Projects similar in construction, location and use, where applicable and available, including, but not limited to, Host Liquor Liability coverage, with respect to events sponsored by the Association, Contractual and All-Written Contract insurance, Workmen's Compensation and Employer's Liability insurance, Comprehensive Automobile Liability insurance, Severability of Interest endorsement, Garage Keepers Liability and Bailee's Liability endorsement.

The Board of Directors shall review such limits once each year, but in no event shall such insurance be less than one million dollars per occurence covering all claims for personal injury, bodily injury, including deaths of persons and property damage. Reasonable amounts of "umbrella" liability insurance in excess of the primary limits may also be obtained.

7.4 Fidelity Insurance.  
The Board of Directors shall obtain and maintain adequate fidelity insurance coverage, to protect against dishonest or fraudulent acts committed by the Association's Directors, Officers, Managing Agent, Trustees, employees or volunteers of the Association and all others who manage or are responsible for handling funds collected and held for the benefit of the Association, provided however, the Board of Directors shall not maintain fidelity coverage to cover any Managing Agent.

Such fidelity coverage shall name the Association as the named insured, be written in an amount sufficient to cover the maximum funds that will be in the custody of the Association or its Managing Agent at any time while the insurance is in force, but must be no less than the sum of three months' of assessments on all Units within The Project, plus the Association's Reserve Funds, and contain waivers of any defense based upon the exclusion of persons who serve without compensation from any definition of "employee" or similar expression.

In the event the Association has delegated some or all of its responsibility for the management of its funds to a Managing Agent, such Managing Agent must be covered by its own fidelity insurance providing the same coverage required of the Association's fidelity insurance. The Association should be named as an obligee in the Managing Agent's fidelity insurance and evidence of such coverage must be submitted to the Association.

7.5 Additional Insurance.
- (a) If the area where The Project is located has been identified by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a Special Flood Hazard Area, flood insurance for The Project shall be maintained providing coverage equivalent to that provided under the National Flood Insurance Program in an amount of one hundred percent of The Project's current replacement cost.

    The Association shall maintain coverage for any detached Common Elements and have separate coverage for each Building housing the Condominium Apartments for one hundred percent of their replacement cost including any machinery and equipment that are a part of the Building. The contents coverage must equal one hundred percent of the replacement cost of all contents, including machinery and equipment which are not part of a Building, that are owned in common with other Owners. A separate Association endorsement is required if not already a part of the policy.

    Deductibles may not exceed the lower of Five Thousand Dollars or one percent of the face amount of the coverage. Funds for such deductibles must be included in the Association's Reserve and be so designated.

    If The Project at the time of the recording of this Declaration is not identified as a Special Flood Hazard Area but becomes reclassified at a later date as such and the Board becomes aware of such reclassification, then the Board of Directors shall obtain flood insurance for The Project in accordance with the above. Conversely flood insurance may be discontinued under certain conditions.

- (b) Adequate Directors and Officers liability insurance, if available, and if deemed consistent with good business practices, for errors and omissions on all Directors and Officers to be written in an amount which the Association deems adequate.

- (c) Broad form machinery and pressure vessel explosion insurance (if applicable) in a minimum amount per accident at least equal to the lesser of two million dollars or the insurable value of the building housing the boiler or machinery.

- (d) If it is determined by a First Mortgagee that the existing coverages do not adequately protect The Project, the Board of Directors shall obtain such additional coverages.

- (e) Such other insurance of a similar or dissimilar nature, as the Board of Directors shall deem appropriate with respect to The Project.

7.6 Payment of Insurance Premiums.  
The cost of the insurance obtained by the Association in accordance with this Article, except for premiums on fidelity bonds maintained by a Managing Agent for its officers, employees and agents, shall be paid from Association funds and be collected from the Owners as part of the Annual Assessment for Common Expenses as provided for in Paragraph 5.3(a) hereof.

7.7 Separate Insurance.  
Each Owner shall have the right, at his own expense, to obtain insurance for his Unit for his own benefit and to obtain insurance coverage upon his personal property, furnishings and for his personal liability provided, however, that no Owner shall be entitled to exercise his right to acquire or maintain such insurance coverage so as to decrease the amount which the Board of Directors, on behalf of all Owners, may realize under any insurance policy maintained by the Board or to cause any insurance coverage maintained by the Board to be brought into contribution with insurance coverage obtained by an Owner. All such policies shall contain waivers of subrogation. No Owner shall obtain separate insurance policies except as provided in this Paragraph.

The Owners of Units to which at least eighty percent of the votes in the Association are allocated may agree, upon due notice to all Owners and granting them an opportunity to be heard, that the Units are obsolete and adopt and record a written "Plan for Renewal and Reconstruction", which Plan must have the approval of those First Mortgagees holding mortgages on Units which have at least eighty percent of the votes of the Units subject to First Mortgagees within The Project. Written notice of adoption of such Plan shall be given to all of the Owners. The expense of renewal or reconstruction shall be payable by all of the Owners as an Annual Assessment for Common Expenses whether or not such Owner may have previously consented to such Plan. The assessment shall be levied, allocated, and collected in the same manner as a Deficiency Assessment as provided for in Paragraph 9.2(f) hereof.


ARTICLE TEN: TERMINATION OF THE CONDOMINIUM PROJECT

10.1 Vote of Owners and First Mortgagees.  
Except in the case of a taking of all the Units by Condemnation or by fire or other casualty, The Project may be terminated only by agreement of the Owners of Units to which at least eighty percent of the votes in the Association are allocated. Such an agreement must have the approval of those First Mortgagees holding mortgages on Units which have at least eighty percent of the votes of the Units subject to first mortgages within The Project.

10.2 Termination Agreement.  
An agreement of Owners to terminate condominium ownership must be evidenced by their execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof. If, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real estate constituting The Project is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of The Project is situated, and is effective only upon recordation.

10.3 Sale of The Project.  
The Association, on behalf of the Owners, may contract for sale of The Project, but the contract is not binding on the Owners until approved pursuant to Paragraphs 10.1 and 10.2. If the real estate constituting The Project is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the Association as trustee for the holders of all interest in the Units. Thereafter, the Association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the Association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale shall be apportioned among the Owners in accordance with Paragraph 10.5 of this Declaration. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the Association holds title to the real estate, each Owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his Unit. During the period in which the Owner has the right of occupancy, each Owner and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on Owners by the Declaration.

10.4 Project not to be Sold.  
If The Property constituting The Project is not to be sold following termination, title to The Property, upon termination, vests in the Owners as tenants in common in proportion to their respective Common Element interests and the liens on the Units shall shift to such Owner's undivided interest. While the tenancy in common exists, each Owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of The Property that formerly constituted his Unit.

10.5 Determination of Owner's Interests.  
The respective interests of Owners referred to in Paragraphs 10.3, 10.4, and 10.6 are pro rata according to each Owner's percentage interest in the Common Elements immediately before termination.

10.6 Distribution to Owners.  
Following termination of The Project, the proceeds derived from the sale shall be divided in proportion to the Owner's respective interests as provided in Paragraph 10.5, and shall be used and disbursed by the Association, as Attorney-in-Fact, in the following order:
- (a) for payment of the balance of the lien of any first mortgage;
- (b) for payment of reasonable costs of sale incurred;
- (c) for payment of taxes and special assessment liens in favor of any assessing entity;
- (d) for payment of unpaid assessments;
- (e) for payment of junior mortgages and encumbrances in the order of and to the extent of their priority;
- (f) the balance remaining, if any, shall be paid to the Owner.

The proceeds of sale described in Paragraph 10.3 and held by the Association as trustee are not assets of the Association.

ARTICLE TWELVE: EXPANSION

12.1 Reservation of Right to Expand.  
Declarant reserves the right (without in any way being bound) to enlarge this condominium project in phases by submitting to The Project from time to time a Supplemental Condominium Map and Supplemental Declaration adding any of the real property described on Exhibit "D" attached hereto. The total number of condominium units in The Project as expanded shall not exceed one hundred sixty-eight Units.

If The Project has been or is to be approved by the Federal Housing Administration and/or the Veterans Administration, any such addition, expansion or annexation must be according to a General Plan heretofore filed with and approved by the Federal Housing Administration or the Veterans Administration and such addition, expansion or annexation must be supported by the written consent of the Federal Housing Administration or the Veterans Administration, evidence of which may be recorded.

12.2 Supplemental Declarations and Supplemental Condominium Maps.  
Such expansion may be accomplished by the filing for record by Declarant in the office of the Clerk and Recorder for Boulder County, Colorado, no later than five years from the date of the recording of this Declaration, a supplement or supplements to this Declaration containing a legal description of the new Real Property or Properties, together with a Supplemental Condominium Map or Maps containing the same information with respect to the new Real Property as was required on the original Condominium Map with respect to the initial Real Property. The expansion may be accomplished in stages by successive supplements or in one supplemental expansion so long as each subsequent phase is contiguous to the Real Property already subject to this Declaration.

All intended improvements in future phases must be substantially completed prior to being brought within the Condominium Project.

12.3 Expansion of Definitions.  
In the event of such expansion, the definitions used in this Declaration shall be expanded automatically to encompass and refer to The Project as so expanded. For example, "Condominium Unit" shall mean the Condominium Units described hereinabove plus any additional Condominium Units added by a Supplemental Condominium Declaration or Declarations, and reference to this Declaration shall mean this Declaration as supplemented. All conveyances of Condominium Units shall be effective to transfer rights in The Project as expanded by use of the form of description set forth in paragraph 2.3 hereof, with additional references to the Supplemental Condominium Declaration(s) and the Supplemental Condominium Map(s). The recordation in the records of Boulder County, Colorado, of a Supplemental Condominium Map or Maps incident to any expansion shall operate automatically to grant, transfer, and convey to the Owners of the Condominium Units the respective undivided interests set forth in Paragraph 12.5 hereof in the new Common Elements added to the Condominium Project as the result of such expansion. Such recordation shall also operate to vest in any then Mortgagee of any Condominium Unit encumbering the new Common Elements added to The Project as the result of such expansion.

12.4 Declaration Operative on New Properties.  
The new Real Property shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this Declaration or Declarations, and the Condominium Units therein shall be subject to the condominium regime with all incidents pertaining thereto as specified herein, upon placing the Supplemental Condominium Map(s) and Supplemental Condominium Declaration(s) of public record in the real estate records of Boulder County, Colorado.

All future improvements to The Project will be consistent with the initial improvements in terms of quality of construction and shall be similar in building types, architectural style and size of Units.

12.5 Interests Upon Enlargements.  
The Owners at the time of their purchase of a Condominium Unit which has been brought into The Project by a Supplemental Declaration and a Supplemental Condominium Map shall be Members of the Association entitled to the same non-exclusive use of the Common Elements and the same voting privileges as those Owners of the initial property brought into The Project through the original Declaration and shall be subject to the same Assessments. The Assessments for that Phase shall commence for all Owners including the Declarant in accordance with Paragraph 5.7 hereof.

Whenever any additional property is brought into the Condominium Project, the interest of each owner of a Condominium Unit in the Common Elements in The Project after such addition shall be determined by the Declarant on the basis of the proportion which the approximate finished square footage area of each Apartment bears to the total approximate finished square footage area of all completed Apartments within The Project (including Apartments created on the additional real property submitted to The Project). The finished square footage area of each Apartment is based upon dimensions which are approximate and the calculation of the percentage interest has been rounded. The Supplemental Declaration recorded at the time of expansion shall set forth the new percentage ownership interests of the existing Units and of the newly added Units.

12.6 Taxes, Assessments and Other Liens.  
All taxes and other assessments relating to the real property described in Exhibit "D" covering any period of time prior to the addition of such property or any portion thereof to The Project must be paid or otherwise provided for by the Declarant to the satisfaction of all First Mortgagees.

Liens arising out of the construction of improvements in later phases shall not extend into prior phases and shall not adversely affect the rights of Owners or the priority of first mortgages and deeds of trusts on any Unit constructed in a prior phase.

12.7 Project Treated as a Whole.  
For all purposes hereof, each of the Phases of The Project after the recording of the Supplemental Map and Supplemental Declaration submitting each Phase to The Project, shall be treated as a part of The Project developed as a whole from the beginning, except to the extent expressly otherwise provided for herein. It is the express purpose hereof to provide that from and after the date of the submission of a Phase of The Project in accordance with the above, that such Phase shall be treated as though such Phase had been developed, owned, occupied and used by the Owners thereof as a single undivided Project.

In furtherance of the foregoing, a power coupled with an interest is hereby reserved and granted to Declarant to make or consent to a Special Amendment on behalf of such Owners of the Units. Each deed, mortgage, trust deed, other evidence of obligation or other instrument affecting a Unit and the acceptance thereof shall be deemed to be a grant and acknowledgement of, and a consent to the reservation of, the power of Declarant to make, execute and record such Special Amendments. No Special Amendment made by Declarant shall affect or impair the lien of the first mortgage or deed of trust upon a Unit or any warranties made by an Owner or First Mortgagee in order to induce any of the above agencies or entities to make, purchase, insure, or guarantee the first mortgage or deed of trust on such Owner's Unit.

EXHIBIT C  
TO THE CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION FOR THE WILDFLOWER CONDOMINIUMS

SCHEDULE OF MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES  

[The format of schedule is heavily modified from recorded version,
but the content is otherwise as identical as possible.]

Maintenance Responsibilities:
1. Common Elements Under Association Responsibility:  
Responsibility for determining and providing for the maintenance, repair and replacement requirements of the Common Elements and determining the costs thereof shall be primarily the responsibility of the Board of Directors and such designees to which it may delegate certain such responsibilities.
2. Limited Common Elements Under Association Responsibility:  
Responsibility for determining the maintenance, repair and replacement requirements of the Common Elements shall be shared responsibility between the Board of Directors and the Owner of a Unit to which a specific Limited Common Element is exclusively appurtenant; provided, however, that the Board shall have the final responsibility for determining the need for and accomplishing such maintenance, repair and replacement activities.
3. Unit Components Under Association Responsibility:  
The items in this column are legally and by definition a part of a Unit but are attached or directly connected to or associated with the Common Elements and common expense items in such a way that a clear distinction between Owner and Association responsibility cannot be made. Moreover, such items frequently involve matters of concern relative to the general health, safety and welfare of all of the occupants of The Building. Thus, certain costs which appear to benefit a single Owner but which affect other Owners are declared a common expense, especially when the correct functioning of an activity or element is integral to or supportive of the legally defined Common Elements and common expenses.
4. Certain Other Components Under Owner's Responsibility Without Respect to Ownership of the Component:  
The items in this column are not intended to be exclusive and all-encompassing and do not affect responsibilities expressly provided for otherwise.

Note: each maintenance function lists all maintenance responsibilities, along with explanatory comments if/when the function falls under that category.  
For each maintenance function:

2. Explanation of limited common element maintenance responsibility

This chart and the titles and headings used herein are not intended to describe or encompass all maintenance functions nor to delineate all respective responsibilities between the Owners, severally, and the Association. The placement of responsibility under any specific column does not always accurately reflect the precise character and nature of ownership. The appropriate sections of the Declaration determine ownership. In many cases maintenance responsibility is allocated to the Association to ensure central maintenance responsibility, uniformity and quality of repair, and to protect community health and safety. Where such maintenance is required due to the negligent or wrongful act or omission of an Owner (or members of his household, tenants, employees, agents, visitors, guests or pets), the Association will perform the necessary maintenance at the sole expense of the Owner.
